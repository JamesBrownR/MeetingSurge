         <p>You're a great mechanic. You do honest work at a fair price. So why is the shop down the street with no clue how to service customers getting more calls than you?</p>
        <p>You probably know the answer. They show up on Google when people search for auto repair. You don't.</p>

        <h2>The Reality of Local Search</h2>
        <p>When someone's check engine light comes on, they don't flip through the Yellow Pages. They grab their phone and search "auto repair near me" or "mechanic open now."</p>
        <p>If your business doesn't appear in those first few results, you might as well be invisible. Unfortunately {or fortunately for your competitors} showing up isn't about being the best. It's about being properly set up. If you aren't showing up, you're doing some of 10 things wrong.</p>

        <h2>1. You Never Claimed Your Google Business Profile</h2>
        <p>This is the most common and most costly. Your Google Business Profile is what shows up when people search for you. It's  what puts you on Google Maps. Not having this is death for where most local searches happen.</p>
        <p><strong>Quick check:</strong> Search your business name on Google. Do you see a "Claim this business" or "Own this business?" button? If yes, you're losing customers as you read this. {Keep reading though... it might get worse.}</p>
        <p>Without claiming your profile, you can't respond to reviews, update your hours, add photos, or show up in "near me" searches. It's like having a store with no sign. People might drive past, but they won't notice you or even think to stop.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Go to google.com/business and claim your listing. Verify it. Then complete every single section of your profile. No exceptions.</p>

        <h2>2. Your Business Information Is Wrong or Incomplete</h2>
        <p>Your address is misspelled. Your phone number is outdated. Your hours say you're open when you're closed. Or maybe half the information is just missing.</p>
        <p>Google doesn't trust incomplete profiles, so it doesn't show them. Customers don't trust businesses that don't bother to get their information right. This screws your business both ways. </p>
        <p><strong>What you need to fix immediately:</strong> Correct business name, accurate address with proper suite/unit numbers, current phone number {that actually gets answered}, updated business hours including holidays, your actual service area, business category {be specific: "Auto Repair Shop" not just "Business"}, and your website URL.</p>
        <p>Every field you don't fill out is a field someone else has. Guess who Google will promote to the top?</p>

        <h2>3. You Have No Reviews {Or They're Old}</h2>
        <p>Reviews are currency. When someone searches for auto repair, Google shows shops with more recent, positive reviews first.</p>
        <p>If you have three reviews from 2019, you're telling Google {and customers} that nobody uses your service anymore. Even if that's not true, that's the message you're sending. And nobody is saying you need hundreds of reviews. You just need more than you have now, and you need them to be recent.</p>
        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Ask satisfied customers for reviews. Not one customer "every once in a while." Consistently, every time. Make it part of your process. Send a text after every job with a direct link to leave a review.</p>
        <p>And when you get a bad review? Respond professionally. Google watches how you handle feedback. So do potential customers.</p>

        <h2>4. You Have Zero Photos</h2>
        <p>Would you eat at a restaurant that had no pictures of their food? Probably not. Same logic applies to your shop.</p>
        <p>Photos show customers what to expect. They build trust. And they tell Google your business is active and legitimate.</p>
        <p><strong>What to upload:</strong> Outside of your shop so customers can find you, your waiting area, your team at work, before/after shots of repairs or detailing, any specialized equipment you have, and your service bays.</p>
        <p>Take them with your phone. They don't need to be professional. They just need to exist.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Website Content Is Barren or Nonexistent</h2>
        <p>If your website is just a homepage with "We fix cars" and a phone number, Google doesn't have much to work with. You need actual content that tells Google and customers what you do and where you do it.</p>
        <p>Google shows people shops doing good work, near them. If your website doesn't clearly tell Google where you're located, what services you offer, and why you're relevant, Google won't rank you.</p>
        <p><strong>What this means:</strong> Your business name, address, and phone number need to be on every page. Your services need to be clearly listed with descriptions. You need to actually say what city you're in if you want customers there.</p>
        <p>If your site just says "Quality Auto Repair" with no location mentioned, Google has no idea where you are or who to show your site to.</p>

        <h2>6. You're Using the Wrong Words</h2>
        <p>You might call it "automotive service." Customers search for "car repair." You might offer "comprehensive diagnostic analysis." They type "check engine light fix."</p>
        <p>If your website doesn't use the exact words and phrases customers are searching for, Google won't connect you with them.</p>
        <p><strong>Think like a customer:</strong> What would you type into Google if your car broke down? Use those exact words on your website. Put your city name and your services together: "Oil change in [Your City]." "Brake repair in [Your City]." Make it obvious where you are and what you do.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Website Is Slow or Broken on Mobile</h2>
        <p>Speed and good layouts aren't optional anymore. Google openly uses them as high-ranking signals. If your site fails on mobile, you're a ghost in search. Period.</p>
        <p><strong>Test it:</strong> Open your website on your phone right now. Does it load in under 3 seconds? Can you easily tap buttons? Can you read the text without zooming? If not, fix it fast.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Business Category Is Wrong</h2>
        <p>This one's technical but important. If you're an auto detail shop but your category is listed as "Car Wash," you won't show up when people search for detailing services.</p>
        <p>Google matches searches to categories. Pick the wrong category, and you're foggy to your ideal customers.</p>
        <p><strong>How to check:</strong> Go to your Google Business Profile and look at your primary category. Is it exactly what you do? If not, change it. You can also add secondary categories, but your primary category matters most.</p>

        <h2>9. You're Not Posting Updates</h2>
        <p>Google Business Profile lets you post special offers, new services, holiday hours, whatever. Most shops never use this feature.</p>
        <p>Big mistake. Posts show Google your business is active. They take up more space in search results, pushing competitors down.</p>
        <p>Post once a week. It takes five minutes and makes a real difference.</p>

        <h2>10. You Have No Backlinks</h2>
        <p>Backlinks are when other websites link to yours. Google sees backlinks as votes of confidence. The more quality sites that link to you, the more Google trusts you.</p>
        <p><strong>How do you get them?</strong> Get listed in local directories {Yelp, YellowPages, local chamber of commerce}. Partner with other local businesses and link to each other. Sponsor a Little League team and get a link from their site. Write a guest post for a local blog. Get featured in local news or community websites.</p>
        <p>You don't need a million backlinks. Even a few puts you ahead.</p>

        <h2>The Ultimate Test</h2>
        <p>Open an incognito browser. Search for the services you offer plus "near me."</p>
        <p>Are you in the top three results? Top five? On the first page at all? If not, you have work to do. Because that's exactly what your potential customers are searching, and they're calling whoever shows up first.</p>

        <h2>What to Do Right Now</h2>
        <p>Start here: </p>

<ul>
 <li>Claim your Google Business Profile if you haven't already.   </li>
 <li>Complete every section of your profile with accurate information. </li>
 <li>Upload at least 10 photos of your business.</li>
 <li>Ask three recent customers for reviews this week. </li>
 <li> Check your website on mobile and fix it if it's broken.</li>
 <li>Add your city name to your website's main pages.</li>
 <li>Create your first post announcing a service or special.</li>
</ul>
        
        <p>These aren't complicated. They're just overlooked. And every day you don't do them is another day your competitors get your customers.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>You don't need to understand algorithms or hire an expensive marketing agency to show up on Google. You just need to take control of your online presence and do the basics right.</p>
        <p>Most of your competitors aren't doing this stuff either. Which means if you do, you'll stand out immediately.</p>
        <p>Your competitors aren't better than you. They're just more visible. Fix your local SEO, and you'll start getting calls. It's that simple.</p>
