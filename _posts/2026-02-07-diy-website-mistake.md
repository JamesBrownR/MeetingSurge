faqs:
  - question: "Can't I just hire someone on Fiverr to build my site cheaper?"
    answer: "You can, but you get what you pay for. Fiverr designers use the same templates as DIY platforms, don't understand auto shop SEO, and disappear when you need changes. You'll spend more fixing their work than hiring a professional from the start."
  
  - question: "What about WordPress with a premium theme?"
    answer: "Better than Wix, but still has issues. Premium themes are bloated with features you don't need, slowing your site. You'll need plugins for everything, creating security risks and compatibility issues. And you still need to know how to optimize for local SEO."
  
  - question: "How much should I actually budget for a professional website?"
    answer: "For auto shops: $2,000-$5,000 for a quality custom site. Includes mobile optimization, local SEO, fast loading speeds, and service-specific pages. One-time investment vs $50-100/month forever on DIY platforms that don't convert."
  
  - question: "Can I start with DIY and upgrade to professional later?"
    answer: "Yes, but you lose months of ranking opportunity and potential customers. Google takes 3-6 months to rank new sites. Starting with a professional site means you're ranking while competitors waste time on DIY. Every month you wait costs you customers."
  
  - question: "What if I don't have photos or content for a professional site?"
    answer: "A good web designer helps with this. They'll tell you what photos to take with your phone and can write service descriptions based on a conversation with you. Content creation is part of professional web design - not a blocker."

    <p>You spent $600 building your own website on Wix. Watched YouTube tutorials for 20 hours. Picked a template. Added your services. Published it. Felt proud.</p>
    <p>Six months later, you've gotten 3 phone calls from it. Maybe.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the shop two miles down the road with a professional website? Booked solid for the next two weeks. Customers finding them on Google. Phone ringing daily.</p>
    <p>Here's why your DIY website is costing you way more than it saved.</p>

    <h2>The Math Everyone Gets Wrong</h2>
    <p>You thought: "Why pay $3,000 for a website when I can build one myself for $20/month?"</p>
    <p>Here's what actually happened:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Time invested:</strong> 20 hours learning Wix, picking templates, customizing, troubleshooting. At your shop rate of $100/hour, that's $2,000 of your time.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Platform fees:</strong> $35/month for business plan × 24 months = $840. Need ecommerce or booking features? That's $50+/month.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Apps and plugins:</strong> SEO tools, contact forms, scheduling. Another $30/month × 24 = $720.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Lost customers:</strong> Here's the big one. A professional site converts 3-5% of visitors into calls. Your DIY site? Maybe 0.5%. If you're getting 500 visitors per month:</p>
    <p>- Professional site: 15-25 calls/month<br>
    - Your DIY site: 2-3 calls/month<br>
    - Lost calls per month: 12-22<br>
    - At $400 average ticket: $4,800-$8,800/month in lost revenue</p>
    
    <p>Over 6 months, that's $28,800 to $52,800 in business you didn't get.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Total DIY cost after 6 months:</strong> $2,000 {time} + $420 {platform} + $360 {apps} + $28,800 {lost revenue} = <strong>$31,580</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Professional site cost:</strong> $3,000 one time.</p>
    
    <p>You didn't save money. You hemorrhaged it.</p>

    <h2>Why You're Invisible on Google</h2>
    <p>You're on page 3 for "brake repair [your city]." Know why?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Your title tags are generic:</strong> Wix auto-generates them as "Home | YourShopName." That doesn't tell Google or customers what you do or where you are.</p>
    
    <p><strong>You have one "Services" page:</strong> Instead of individual pages for brake repair, oil changes, transmission work. Google can't tell what specific services you offer, so you don't rank for any of them.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Your site doesn't mention your city:</strong> Because the template doesn't have a place for it, and you didn't know it mattered. Google has no idea where you're located beyond your contact page.</p>
    
    <p><strong>No schema markup:</strong> You don't even know what that is. {It's code that tells Google you're a local business with specific services and hours.}</p>
    
    <p>Professional sites are built for SEO from day one. Proper title tags. Service-specific pages. Schema markup. Local keywords. Everything Google needs to rank you.</p>
    
    <p>That's why professional sites show up on page 1 while yours is buried.</p>

    <h2>The Mobile Disaster You Don't See</h2>
    <p>You built your site on a laptop. It looks fine on your laptop. Congrats.</p>
    
    <p>Now open it on your phone. Actually do it. Pull out your phone right now and visit your site.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What you'll probably see:</strong></p>
    <p>- Text too small to read without zooming<br>
    - Buttons too small to tap accurately<br>
    - Phone number that isn't clickable<br>
    - Forms that are impossible to fill out on mobile<br>
    - Images that don't fit the screen</p>
    
    <p>76% of people searching for auto repair are on their phones. If your site doesn't work on mobile, you lose 3 out of 4 potential customers immediately.</p>
    
    <p>Wix has "mobile optimization," but it's automatic. It guesses what your mobile site should look like. And it usually guesses wrong.</p>
    
    <p>Professional sites are designed mobile-first. Every element is built and tested on mobile before desktop. Because that's where your customers actually are.</p>

    <h2>The Speed Problem Killing Your Rankings</h2>
    <p>Your Wix site takes 6-8 seconds to load on mobile. Test it at PageSpeed Insights right now.</p>
    
    <p>Here's what happens in those 6-8 seconds: 53% of mobile visitors leave. They hit the back button and call your competitor whose site loaded in 2 seconds.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why DIY platforms are slow:</strong> They load every feature whether you use it or not. Drag-and-drop builders create bloated code. You're on shared hosting with thousands of other sites. Images aren't optimized. Every app you add slows it down more.</p>
    
    <p>Google uses site speed as a ranking factor. Slow sites rank lower in search results. Which means fewer people even find your site to begin with.</p>
    
    <p>Professional sites are hand-coded, use optimized images, and quality hosting. They load in under 3 seconds even on slow connections. Fast sites rank higher. More people find you. More people stay. More people call.</p>

    <h2>Real Cost Comparison Over 2 Years</h2>
    <p>Let's be completely honest about the numbers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>DIY Website {Wix Business Plan}:</strong></p>
    <p>- Setup time: 20 hours @ $100/hr = $2,000<br>
    - Monthly platform fee: $35 × 24 = $840<br>
    - Apps and plugins: $30 × 24 = $720<br>
    - Time spent on updates: 2 hrs/month × 24 × $100 = $4,800<br>
    - Lost customers due to poor conversion: $2,000/month × 24 = $48,000<br>
    - <strong>Total: $56,360</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Professional Custom Website:</strong></p>
    <p>- One-time design & development: $3,500<br>
    - Hosting: $20/month × 24 = $480<br>
    - Optional maintenance: $100/month × 24 = $2,400<br>
    - <strong>Total: $6,380</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Difference: $49,980</strong></p>
    
    <p>And that's being conservative on the lost revenue from poor conversion rates.</p>

    <h2>What You Should Do Instead</h2>
    <p>If you already have a DIY site, here's your path forward:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Option 1: Keep limping along</strong> with your current site, losing customers every single day while competitors dominate local search.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Option 2: Invest in a professional site</strong> that actually converts visitors into customers, ranks on Google, and pays for itself in the first month.</p>
    
    <p>If you're just starting out and considering DIY, do the math. Factor in your time, opportunity cost, and lost customers. Then compare it to professional design.</p>
    
    <p>The shops dominating your local market aren't using Wix. They invested in professional web design. They show up on Google. Their phones ring. They're booked.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>DIY websites feel like a smart budget decision. They're actually one of the most expensive mistakes auto shop owners make.</p>
    
    <p>You save $2,500 upfront and lose $50,000 over two years. That's not frugal. That's financial self-sabotage.</p>
    
    <p>Your competitors with professional sites aren't smarter than you. They didn't get lucky. They made the investment you're avoiding. And they're eating your lunch because of it.</p>
    
    <p>You can keep trying to compete with a Wix template, or you can get serious about your online presence and invest in a website that actually works.</p>
    
    <p>Your call.</p>
