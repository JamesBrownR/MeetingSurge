       <p>Your website is the first impression potential customers have of your auto service business. So how do you know when your current site isn't giving you a good look? Here are clear signs that your site needs a redesign.</p>

        <h2>1. Your Website Doesn't Work on Mobile</h2>
        <p>More than 60% of people searching for auto repair services use their phones. If your website looks broken on mobile devices or customers have to pinch and zoom to read anything, you're losing business every single day.</p>
        <p><strong>Quick test:</strong> Pull up your website on your phone right now. Can customers easily find your phone number? Click to call? Book an appointment in under 5 clicks? If not, it's time for a redesign.</p>

        <h2>2. You're Not Getting Calls From It</h2>
        <p>A website should work for you. If you're not getting meetings from the site you paid for, then you're getting worked instead. Maybe your contact information is buried, your call-to-action buttons are unclear, or potential customers simply can't figure out what you offer. Regardless, nobody buys. </p>
        <p>Your website should make it dead simple for customers to contact you or book appointments. If it doesn't, you're leaving money on the table.</p>

        <h2>3. Your Site Looks Outdated</h2>
        <p>First impressions matter. If your website looks like it was built in 2010, customers will assume your business is stuck in the past too. Modern customers expect a modern experience.</p>
        <p>Design trends change, and a dated website signals that you're not keeping up. Customers want to know they're working with a business that invests in quality and stays current.</p>

        <h2>4. Your Competitors Have Better Websites</h2>
        <p>Do a quick search for auto repair shops in your area. If your competitors' websites look more professional, load faster, and make it easier to book appointments, they're stealing your customers's cars.</p>
        <p>You don't need the fanciest website on the internet. You just need one that doesn't make customers think "Can I even trust you?" when they see it.</p>

        <h2>5. You Can't Update It Quickly</h2>
        <p>If you can't call a developer every time you want to change your hours, update a price, or add a service, your website is working against you. Simple updates shouldn't cost you time and money.</p>
        <p>A good website should be easy to manage. You should be able to make basic changes whenever you need to, without technical headaches.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Site Loads Slowly</h2>
        <p>Doesn't seem important. But customers won't wait. If your website takes more than 3 seconds to load, most people will hit the back button and call your competitor instead.</p>
        <p>Slow websites annoy customers and hurt your Google rank. Speed matters more than you think.</p>

        <h2>7. You're Embarrassed to Share Your Website</h2>
        <p>This is the simplest test. When someone asks for your website, do you love sharing it, or do you cringe a little? If you're not happy to send people to your site, your potential clients certainly aren't happy to look at it.</p>
        <p>Your website should show your experience and make you look like the professional you are.</p>

        <h2>What to Do Next</h2>
        <p>If your business checks any of these, you're losing money. Every day with an outdated website is another day you lose customers.</p>
        <p>A professional website redesign doesn't have to take months or cost a fortune. The right web designer (humbly, me) can have you up and running with a modern, mobile-friendly site in as little as 1-2 weeks.</p>
