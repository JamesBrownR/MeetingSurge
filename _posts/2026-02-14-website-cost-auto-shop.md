faqs:
  - question: "Why do some designers charge $200 and others charge $2,000?"
    answer: "Price reflects what you're actually getting. A $200 site is usually a template with your logo swapped in. No SEO, no custom code, no strategy. A $2,000-3,000 site is custom-built for your shop, optimized for local search, and designed to convert visitors into calls. The cheap site costs you more in lost customers."

  - question: "Do I have to pay monthly fees on top of the design cost?"
    answer: "For hosting, yes, typically $15-30/month. That's unavoidable regardless of who builds your site. Some designers also charge monthly maintenance fees. Others, like MeetingSurge, build on platforms where you own everything outright with no recurring fees beyond hosting."

  - question: "Can I get a good website for under $1,000?"
    answer: "Technically yes, but you'd be getting a DIY template with minimal customization and no SEO strategy. Most shops that go that route end up rebuilding within a year. The math usually doesn't work in your favor. Read our breakdown on why DIY websites cost more than they save."

  - question: "How long does it take to see results from a new website?"
    answer: "Google takes 30-90 days to index and rank a new site. Most shops start getting more calls within 60 days of launching a properly optimized site. The faster you launch, the faster you rank."

  - question: "Is a $2,000 website worth it for a small shop?"
    answer: "If one new customer per month stays loyal for a year, that's easily $2,000-5,000 in revenue. A good website should bring in more than one new customer per month. Most shops see ROI within the first 60-90 days."

    <p>You need a website. You've gotten quotes ranging from $300 to $8,000. You have no idea what you're actually paying for, or what you actually need.</p>
    <p>Here's the honest breakdown. No upsell, no fluff. Just what auto shop websites cost in 2026, what each price point gets you, and where the money actually goes.</p>

    <h2>The Short Answer</h2>
    <p>A professional website for an auto shop runs <strong>$1,500 to $5,000</strong> as a one-time cost, plus $15-30/month for hosting.</p>
    <p>Below $1,500? You're getting a template. Above $5,000? You're overpaying unless you're a large multi-location shop.</p>
    <p>That's the range. Now let's break down what you actually get at each level.</p>

    <h2>Tier 1: $0 - $500 (DIY or Fiverr)</h2>
    <p>This is the Wix, Squarespace, or "my nephew built it" territory.</p>
    <p><strong>What you get:</strong> A template with your logo swapped in. A Services page. A contact form. It looks like a website.</p>
    <p><strong>What you don't get:</strong> Local SEO. Custom code. Service-specific pages. Schema markup. Speed optimization. Any strategy whatsoever.</p>
    <p><strong>The real cost:</strong> Customers searching "brake repair near me" won't find you. The shop down the road with a real site gets the call. You don't. We've done the math on this. The average shop loses $2,000+ per month in customers to a site that doesn't rank. Over a year, your "free" website costs you $24,000 in missed business.</p>
    <p>Skip this tier.</p>

    <h2>Tier 2: $500 - $1,500 (Budget Freelancer)</h2>
    <p>You'll find designers in this range on Upwork, Fiverr, or local Craigslist posts.</p>
    <p><strong>What you get:</strong> A slightly more customized template. Someone who can follow instructions. A faster turnaround.</p>
    <p><strong>What you don't get:</strong> Someone who understands auto shop SEO. Someone who knows what keywords your customers are searching. Someone who's built sites that actually rank locally.</p>
    <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Most budget freelancers build a site that looks fine... but does nothing for your Google ranking. Pretty is easy. Ranking is a skill.</p>
    <p>You'll spend $1,000 and still not show up when someone searches for your services. Then you'll spend another $1,500 rebuilding it six months later.</p>

    <h2>Tier 3: $1,500 - $3,500 (Professional, Specialty-Focused)</h2>
    <p>This is where you start getting a real return on your investment.</p>
    <p>A designer who specializes in auto shops, or local service businesses, understands what your customers are searching for and how Google ranks local businesses. They're not guessing. They've done it before.</p>
    <p><strong>What's included at this level:</strong></p>
    <p>- Custom design (not a template)<br>
    - Mobile-first build  works perfectly on phones<br>
    - Individual service pages (/brake-repair, /oil-change, /transmission-repair)<br>
    - Local SEO: your city + services woven in throughout<br>
    - Schema markup so Google knows you're a local business<br>
    - Fast loading (under 3 seconds on mobile)<br>
    - Click-to-call on every page<br>
    - Google Business Profile integration</p>
    <p>This is what most auto shops actually need. A site built to rank and convert. Not just look decent.</p>

    <h2>Tier 4: $3,500+ (Agency Territory)</h2>
    <p>Big agencies. Project managers. Account executives. Lots of meetings.</p>
    <p>The work is often outsourced to junior designers anyway. You pay a premium for the brand name.</p>
    <p>For most auto shops, this is overkill. You're paying for overhead, not results.</p>

    <h2>What Affects the Price</h2>
    <p>Two shops can pay very different amounts depending on what they actually need. Here's what moves the number up or down:</p>
    <p><strong>Number of pages:</strong> A 5-page site (Home, Services, About, Contact, Reviews) costs less than a 15-page site with individual pages for every service. More pages = more work = higher price. But more pages also means more ranking opportunities.</p>
    <p><strong>Content creation:</strong> If you need the designer to write everything from scratch, that adds cost. If you can provide rough notes or existing content, it's less.</p>
    <p><strong>Special features:</strong> Online booking, customer portals, live chat integrations, all add to the build time.</p>
    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Need it in a week? Rush fees are real. Most custom sites take 1-3 weeks at a normal pace.</p>
    <p><strong>Ongoing maintenance:</strong> Some designers include a monthly retainer for updates, new blog posts, and SEO monitoring. Others charge per project. Both can work. Depends on how much you want to stay hands-off after launch.</p>

    <h2>The Monthly Costs You Can't Avoid</h2>
    <p>No matter who builds your site, you'll have recurring costs:</p>
    <p><strong>Hosting:</strong> $15-30/month for quality hosting. Don't cheap here. Slow hosting kills your Google ranking. GoDaddy's cheapest plan is a false economy.</p>
    <p><strong>Domain:</strong> $12-15/year. Already have one? Good.</p>
    <p><strong>SSL certificate:</strong> Free through most hosts now. Make sure it's included.</p>
    <p>That's it. A good custom site doesn't require $100/month in plugins and platform fees the way Wix or WordPress templates do.</p>

    <h2>The Question You Should Actually Be Asking</h2>
    <p>Most shop owners ask: "How do I spend the least on a website?"</p>
    <p>That's the wrong question.</p>
    <p>The right question: "What does it cost me every month to NOT have a website that converts?"</p>
    <p>If your current site gets 300 visitors a month and converts 0.5% of them, that's 1-2 calls. A professionally optimized site converts 3-5%. That's 9-15 calls from the same traffic.</p>
    <p>At $400 average ticket, that gap is $2,800-$5,200 per month in lost revenue.</p>
    <p>The $3,000 website pays for itself in the first month.</p>

    <h2>What MeetingSurge Charges</h2>
    <p>Since you're reading this on my site, you're probably wondering what I charge.</p>
    <p>Most auto shop sites I build fall in the <strong>$1,500-$3,500 range</strong>. Custom-coded. No templates. Mobile-first. Built to rank locally from day one.</p>
    <p>The exact number depends on how many pages you need and what features matter to your shop. I'd rather give you an accurate quote after a quick conversation than throw out a number that's wrong.</p>
    <p>No long contracts. No surprise fees. You own everything after launch.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Budget for $1,500-$3,500 if you're serious about getting customers from your website.</p>
    <p>Spend less and you'll likely spend it twice.</p>
    <p>Spend more and you're probably paying for things you don't need.</p>
    <p>Get quotes. Ask what's included. Ask if they've built sites for auto shops before. Ask how the sites they've built rank locally. Ask to see their portfolio.</p>
    <p>A good website isn't a cost. It's the best-performing employee your shop has. Works 24/7, never calls in sick, and sends you customers while you sleep.</p>
    <p>Invest in it accordingly.</p>
