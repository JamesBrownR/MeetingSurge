    <p>You claimed your Google Business Profile. You filled out the basics. You even got a few reviews. But your phone still isn't ringing, and customers are calling your competitors instead.</p>
    <p>Here's the truth: having a Google Business Profile isn't enough. Most shops have one. The shops getting calls have one that's actually optimized. Let me show you exactly what you're doing wrong and how to fix it.</p>

   <h2>Google's New AI is Answering Questions About Your Business</h2>
<p>Google is replacing the old Q&A with an AI that answers customer questions about your business in real-time.</p>
<p>Here's the problem: if your Google Business Profile information is incomplete or inaccurate, Google's AI will give customers wrong answers about your business. Or worse, it won't mention you at all.</p>
<p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Every section of your GBP is now more important than ever. The AI pulls from your business description, services, hours, attributes, reviews, and photos to answer questions like "Do they work on diesels?" or "Are they open on weekends?"</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Make sure <strong>every section of your profile</strong> is complete and accurate. The more detailed and up-to-date your info, the more Google's AI shows your business to ideal customers.</p>

<h2>Your Profile Is 60% Complete {And Google Knows It}</h2>
    <p>Google doesn't show incomplete profiles. Why would they? They want to send searchers to businesses that look legitimate and trustworthy.</p>
    <p>You filled out your business name, address, phone number, and called it a day. Congrats. You're still basically invisible in local searches.</p>
    <p><strong>Quick test:</strong> Log into your Google Business Profile. Look for the circle "Profile Strength" meter. If it's not at 100%, you're losing customers to shops that finished the job.</p>
    <p><strong>What "complete" means:</strong> Business description filled out, all relevant categories selected {primary + secondary}, accurate business hours including holidays, high-quality photos of your shop and work, services listed with descriptions, attributes selected {wheelchair accessible, free Wi-Fi, etc.}, and booking links or website URL added.</p>
    <p>Every blank field is a reason for Google to show your competitor instead of you.</p>

    <h2>Your Business Category Is Wrong</h2>
    <p>This might be the single biggest mistake I see. Your primary category determines when you show up in searches.</p>
    <p>If you're an auto detailer but your category is "Car Wash," you won't show up when people search "auto detailing near me." If you're a mechanic listed as "Auto Body Shop," you're missing everyone searching for repairs.</p>
    <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Go to your Google Business Profile. Click "Edit Profile." Find your primary category. Make sure it's exactly what you do. If you're a full-service auto repair shop, your primary category should be "Auto Repair Shop" - not "Car Repair," not "Mechanic," not "Automotive Service."</p>
    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> You can add secondary categories too. If you do both repair and detailing, add both. But your primary category matters most. That's what Google uses for most of your search visibility.</p>

    <h2>You Have Zero Recent Photos</h2>
    <p>Photos are one of the highest-ranking factors for Google Business Profiles. Shops with recent, quality photos get significantly more clicks and calls.</p>
    <p>But I see profiles with three blurry photos from 2019. Or worse, no photos at all... leaving the generic Street View image of your building.</p>
    <p>Google wants fresh content. If your most recent photo is two years old, Google assumes you're not active {possibly even closed}.</p>
    <p><strong>What you need to upload:</strong> Exterior of your shop {so customers can find you}, your waiting area or customer lounge, your service bays, your team at work, before/after shots of repairs or details, any specialized equipment, and photos of satisfied customers picking up their vehicles {with permission}.</p>
    <p><strong>Upload schedule:</strong> Add at least 3-5 new photos every month. Yes, every month. It tells Google you're active and improves your ranking.</p>
    <p>You don't need a professional photographer. Pull out your phone and take decent, well-lit photos. Just make sure they're not blurry and actually show what you do.</p>

    <h2>You're Not Responding to Reviews</h2>
    <p>When someone leaves you a review {good or bad} and you ignore it, you're telling Google and potential customers you don't care about feedback.</p>
    <p>Google actually tracks response rates. Businesses that respond to reviews rank higher than businesses that don't.</p>
    <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Respond to every single review within 24 hours. Every. Single. One.</p>
    <p><strong>For positive reviews:</strong> "Thanks [Name]! We're glad we could help with your [service]. See you next time!" Keep it short, personal, and genuine.</p>
    <p><strong>For negative reviews:</strong> Stay professional. Acknowledge the issue. Offer to fix it. Take it offline. "Thanks for the feedback, [Name]. We take every customer's experience seriously. Please give us a call at [phone] so we can make this right."</p>

    <h2>You Haven't Listed Your Services</h2>
    <p>Google lets you list specific services in your profile. Most shops skip this entirely. Big mistake.</p>
    <p>When someone searches "brake repair near me," Google looks at service listings. If your competitor has "Brake Repair" listed as a service and you don't, guess who shows up first?</p>
    <p><strong>How to add services:</strong> Log into your Google Business Profile. Go to "Services." Add every service you offer. Be specific: "Oil Change," "Brake Repair," "Engine Diagnostics," "Transmission Repair," etc.</p>
    <p>For each service, add a brief description. You don't need paragraphs - just 2-3 sentences explaining what's included.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you're comfortable sharing prices, add starting prices or price ranges. "Oil Change: Starting at $49.99." This alone can increase your click-through rate by 20-30%.</p>

    <h2>Your Hours Are Wrong {Or Incomplete}</h2>
    <p>Nothing kills trust faster than showing up to a shop that's supposed to be open and finding it closed.</p>
    <p>If your hours are wrong on Google, customers will try your competitor instead. And if you don't have special hours listed {holidays, after-hours emergency service}, you're missing calls.</p>
    <p><strong>What to update:</strong> Regular business hours for every day. Special hours for holidays {update these in advance}. If you offer emergency service, add that with a note. If you have different hours for certain services {like after-hours drop-off}, include that.</p>
    <p>And here's the big one: update your hours in real-time if you have to close unexpectedly. Google lets you mark your business as "Temporarily Closed" or adjust hours immediately. Use it.</p>

    <h2>You're Not Using Google Posts</h2>
    <p>Google Posts are free advertising that most shops completely ignore. They appear right in your Business Profile, take up space in search results, and signal to Google that you're an active business.</p>
    <p><strong>What to post:</strong> Special offers or promotions, new services you've added, seasonal reminders {winter tire checks, AC tune-ups}, holiday hours, customer appreciation events, or hiring announcements.</p>
    <p><strong>How often:</strong> At least once a week. More is better. If you're not posting regularly, your profile looks dead.</p>
    <p>Posts don't need to be long. A photo, 2-3 sentences, and a call-to-action button {Call Now, Book, Learn More} is perfect.</p>

    <h2>Your Profile Has Incorrect or Inconsistent NAP</h2>
    <p>NAP = Name, Address, Phone Number. If your NAP isn't identical everywhere online {your website, Google, Yelp, Facebook, directories}, Google ranks you lower.</p>
    <p><strong>Common mistakes:</strong> Using "St." on Google but "Street" on your website. Phone number formatted differently {(555) 123-4567 vs 555-123-4567}. Business name different across platforms. Suite numbers missing.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Pick one format for your NAP and use it everywhere. Exactly the same. Every single time. Then audit all your online listings and update them to match.</p>
    <p>Yes, it's annoying. Yes, it matters. Google trusts consistent information. Inconsistency makes you look sketchy.</p>

    <h2>You're Not Tracking What Works</h2>
    <p>Google gives you insights on how customers find you, what actions they take, and where you're showing up in searches. Most shop owners never look at this data.</p>
    <p><strong>What to check monthly:</strong> How many people viewed your profile. How many clicked your website, called, or requested directions. What search queries brought people to you. How your views and actions compare to competitors in your area.</p>
    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> If you're getting lots of profile views but no calls, your phone number or CTA might be hard to find. If you're not showing up for certain search terms, you might need to change your categories or services. If competitors are outperforming you, you need to figure out what they're doing differently.</p>
    <p>Go to "Performance" in your Google Business Profile. Look at the data. Adjust based on what you find.</p>

    <h2>What to Fix Right Now</h2>
    <p>Don't try to fix everything at once. Start with the highest-impact changes:</p>
    <p><strong>This week:</strong> Make sure your business category is correct. Upload 10 new, quality photos. Respond to all unanswered reviews.</p>
    <p><strong>This month:</strong> Complete every section of your profile to 100%. Add all your services with descriptions. Start posting weekly updates. Set up messaging and Q&A.</p>
    <p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Ask for new reviews every single week. Upload new photos monthly. Respond to all reviews within 24 hours. Post weekly updates.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Your Google Business Profile is free advertising that works 24/7. But only if you use it right.</p>
    <p>Most auto shops claim their profile and forget about it. That's why your competitors are getting the calls. They didn't stop at claiming. They optimized it, maintained it, and now they're ranking above you.</p>
    <p>The good news? This is all fixable. You don't need to hire an expensive agency. You don't need technical skills. You just need to follow this checklist and actually do the work.</p>
    <p>Complete your profile. Upload photos. Get reviews. Post updates. Respond to customers. Do this consistently and watch your ranking improve.</p>
