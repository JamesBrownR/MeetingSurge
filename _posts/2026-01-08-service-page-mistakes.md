    <p>You claimed your Google Business Profile. You filled out the basics. You even got a few reviews. But your phone still isn't ringing, and customers are calling your competitors instead.</p>
    <p>Here's the truth: having a Google Business Profile isn't enough. Most shops have one. The shops getting calls have one that's actually optimized. Let me show you exactly what you're doing wrong and how to fix it.</p>

   <h2>Google's New AI is Answering Questions About Your Business</h2>
<p>At the start of 2026, Google replaced the old Q&A with AI to answer customer questions about your business in real-time.</p>
<p>The problem: if your GBP information is incomplete or inaccurate, Google's AI will give customers wrong answers about your business. Or worse, it won't mention you at all.</p>
<p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Every section of your GBP is now more important than ever. The AI pulls from your business website pages, description, services, reviews, and photos to answer questions like "Do they work on diesels?" or "Are they open on weekends?"</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Make sure <strong>every section of your profile and every page of your website</strong> is complete and accurate. The more detailed and up-to-date your info, the more Google's AI shows your business to ideal customers.</p>

<h2>Your Profile Is 60% Complete {And Google Knows It}</h2>
    <p>Google hides incomplete profiles. Why wouldn't they? They want to send customers to shops that look legitimate and trustworthy.</p>
    <p>If you filled out your business name, address, phone number, and called it a day? Congrats. You're still basically invisible in local searches.</p>
    <p><strong>Quick test:</strong> Log into your Google Business Profile. Look for the circle "Profile Strength" meter. If it's not at 100%, you're losing customers to shops that finished the job.</p>
    <p><strong>What "complete" means:</strong> Business description filled out, all relevant categories selected {primary + secondary}, accurate business hours including holidays, high-quality photos of your shop and work, services listed with descriptions, attributes selected {wheelchair accessible, free Wi-Fi, etc.}, and most importantly your website URL added.</p>
    <p>Every blank field is a reason for Google to show your competitor instead of you.</p>

        <h2>Your Profile Has Patchy NAP</h2>
    <p>NAP = Name, Address, Phone Number. If your NAP isn't identical everywhere {your website, Google, Yelp, Facebook, directories}, Google ranks you lower.</p>
    <p><strong>Common mistakes:</strong> Using "St." on Google but "Street" on your website. Phone number formatted differently {(555) 123-4567 vs 555-123-4567}. Business name different across platforms. Suite numbers missing.</p>
    <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Pick *one* format for your NAP and use it everywhere. Then update all your online listings to match.</p>
    <p>Yes, it's annoying. Yes, it matters. Google trusts consistent information. Inconsistency makes you look sketchy.</p>

  <h2>You're Not Responding to Reviews</h2>
    <p>When someone leaves you a review {good or bad} and you ignore it, you tell Google and potential buyers you don't care about customers.</p>
    <p>Google tracks if you respond and how soon you do it. Businesses that respond to ALL reviews FAST rank higher than businesses that do just one. Businesses that do neither get the bottom of the barrel.</p>
    <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Respond to every single review within 24 hours. Every. Single. One.</p>
    <p><strong>For positive reviews:</strong> "Thanks [Name]! We're glad we could help with your [service]. See you next time!" Keep it short, personal, and genuine.</p>
    <p><strong>For negative reviews:</strong> Stay professional. Acknowledge the issue. Offer to fix it. Take it offline. "Thanks for the feedback, [Name]. We take every customer's experience seriously. Please give us a call at [phone] so we can make this right."</p>

      <h2>You Have Zero Recent Photos</h2>
    <p>Photos are one of the highest-ranking factors for Google Business Profiles. Shops with recent, quality photos get way more clicks and calls.</p>
    <p>But I see profiles with three blurry photos from 2019. Or worse, no photos at all... leaving the generic Street View image of your building.</p>
    <p>Look, Google wants fresh content. If your most recent photo is two years old, Google assumes you're not active {possibly even closed}.</p>
    <p><strong>What you need to upload:</strong> Exterior of your shop {so customers can find you}, your waiting area or customer lounge, your service bays, your team at work, before/after shots of repairs or details, any specialized equipment, and photos of satisfied customers picking up their vehicles {with permission}.</p>
    <p><strong>Upload schedule:</strong> Add at least 3-5 new photos every month. Yes, every month. It tells Google you're active and improves your ranking.</p>
    <p>You don't need a professional photographer. Pull out your phone and take decent, well-lit photos. Just make sure they're not blurry and actually show what you do.</p>

    
    <h2>Your Business Category Is Wrong</h2>
    <p>This might be the single biggest mistake I see. Your primary category controls who you show up for in searches.</p>
    <p>If you're an auto detailer but your category is "Car Wash," you won't show up as much when people search "auto detailing near me." If you're a mechanic listed as "Auto Body Shop," you're missing people searching for repairs.</p>
    <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Go to your Google Business Profile. Click "Edit Profile." Find your primary category. Make sure it's exactly what you do. If you're a full-service auto repair shop, your primary category should be "Auto Repair Shop" - not "Car Repair," not "Mechanic," not "Automotive Service."</p>
    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> You can add secondary categories too. If you do both repair and detailing, add both. But your primary category matters most. That's what Google uses for most of your search visibility.</p>

  
  

    <h2>You Haven't Listed Your Services</h2>
    <p>Google lets you list specific services in your profile. Most shops skip this entirely. Big mistake.</p>
    <p>When someone searches "brake repair near me," Google looks at service listings. If your competitor has "Brake Repair" listed as a service and you don't, guess who shows up first?</p>
    <p><strong>How to add services:</strong> Log into your Google Business Profile. Go to "Services." Add every service you offer. Be specific: "Oil Change," "Brake Repair," "Engine Diagnostics," "Transmission Repair," etc.</p>
    <p>For each service, add a brief description. You don't need paragraphs - just 2-3 sentences explaining what's included.</p>
    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you're comfortable sharing prices, add starting prices or price ranges. "Oil Change: Starting at $49.99".</p>

    <h2>Your Hours Are Wrong {Or Incomplete}</h2>
    <p>Nothing kills trust faster than showing up to a shop that should be open and finding it closed.</p>
    <p>If your hours are wrong, customers will rely on a competitor instead. And if you don't have special hours listed {holidays, after-hours emergency service}, you're missing calls during those events.</p>
    <p><strong>What to update:</strong> Your actual business hours for every day. Special hours for holidays {update these in advance}. If you offer emergency service, add that with a note. If you have different hours for certain services {like after-hours drop-off}, include that.</p>
    <p>And here's the big one: update your hours in real-time if you have to close unexpectedly. Google lets you mark your business as "Temporarily Closed". Use it.</p>

    <h2>You're Not Using Google Posts</h2>
    <p>Google Posts are free advertising most shops completely ignore. They appear right in your Business Profile, take up space in search results, and tell Google you're an active business.</p>
    <p><strong>What to post:</strong> Special offers or promotions, new services you've added, seasonal reminders {winter tire checks, AC tune-ups}, holiday hours, customer appreciation events, or hiring announcements.</p>
    <p><strong>How often:</strong> At least once a week. More is better. If you're not posting regularly, your profile looks dead.</p>
    <p>Posts don't need to be long. A photo, 2-3 sentences, and a call-to-action button {Call Now, Book, Learn More} is perfect.</p>



    <h2>What to Fix Right Now</h2>
    <p>Don't try to fix everything at once. Start with the highest-impact changes:</p>
    <p><strong>This week:</strong> Make sure your business category is correct. Upload 10 new, quality photos. Respond to all unanswered reviews.</p>
    <p><strong>This month:</strong> Complete every section of your profile to 100%. Add all your services with descriptions. Start posting weekly updates.</p>
    <p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Ask for new reviews every single week. Upload new photos monthly. Respond to all reviews within 24 hours. Post weekly updates.</p>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Your Google Business Profile is {free} advertising 24/7. But only if you use it right.</p>
    <p>Competitors are getting calls because they didn't stop at claiming. They add the tedious information, respond to customers and upload photos. Now they're ranking above you.</p>
    <p>The good news? This is all fixable. You don't need technical skills. You just need to follow this checklist and do the work.</p>
    <p>Complete your profile. Upload photos. Get reviews. Respond to them. Post updates. Do it consistently and watch your ranking soar.</p>
